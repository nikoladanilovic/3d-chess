# 🧊 3D Chess Cube

A unique 3D chess-inspired strategy game built using **Godot 4**, set inside a hollow 8x8x8 cube. Unlike traditional chess, this game plays out in full 3D space, introducing new movement mechanics and tactical possibilities.

## 🧠 Concept

- A chess-like game set **within a 3D cube** grid (8x8x8).
- Players move pieces along X, Y, and Z axes.
- The cube is hollow — all gameplay takes place on the surfaces and edges.
- Rules and piece movements are inspired by chess, but adapted to a 3D environment.

## 🎮 Features

- ✅ 3D grid rendering and interaction
- ✅ Fully navigable camera system
- ✅ Custom 3D chess pieces
- ✅ Turn-based logic
- ✅ 3D movement rules per piece 
- ✅ Win conditions and check logic 
- 🧪 AI and multiplayer modes (planned)
